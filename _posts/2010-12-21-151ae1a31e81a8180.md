Declaration of Independence

　　In Congress, July 4, 1776

　　The Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America

　　When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature‘s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

　　We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. ——Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

　　He has refused his assent to laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

　　He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

　　He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

　　He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

　　He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

　　He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise; the state remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

　　He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.

　　He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.

　　He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

　　He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.

　　He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies without the consent of our legislature.

　　He has affected to render the military independent of and superior to civil power.

　　He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation:

　　For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

　　For protecting them, by mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states:

　　For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:

　　For imposing taxes on us without our consent:

　　For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury:

　　For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses:

　　For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule in these colonies:

　　For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments:

　　For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

　　He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us.

　　He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burned our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

　　He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.

　　He has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.

　　He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare, is undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

　　In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

　　Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.

　　We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.

　　1776年7月4日，美利坚合众国13个州的一致宣言。

　　在人类历史事件的进程中，当一个民族有必要解除其与另一民族相连结的政治桎梏，并按照自然法则和上帝的意旨在世界列强中取得独立与平等的地位时，对于人类舆论的真诚与尊重，要求他们必须将不得已而独立的原因予以宣布。

　　我们认为以下真理是不言而喻的：人人生而平等，造物主赋予他们某些不可转让的权利，其中包括生命权、自由权和追求幸福的权利。为了保障这些权利，人们建立起来被管辖者同意的政府。任何形式的政府，一旦破坏这些目标，人民就有权利去改变它或废除它，并建立一个新的政府。新政府所根据的原则及其组织权力的方式，务必使人民认为，唯有这样才最有可能保障他们的安全与幸福。诚然，慎重会使得一个建立已久的政府不因微不足道的和暂时的原因而被改变，过去的一切经验也表明，人类更倾向于忍受尚能忍受的苦难，而不去为了拯救自己而废除他们久已习惯了的政府形式。但是，当滥用职权和巧取豪夺的行为连绵不断、层出不穷，证明政府追求的目标是企图把人民置于专制主义统治之下时，人民就有权利，也有义务推翻这样的政府，并为他们未来的安全建立新的保障。这就是我们这些殖民地的人民一向忍受的苦难，以及现在不得不起来改变原先政治制度的原因。

　　当今大不列颠王国的历史，就是一部反复重演的伤天害理、巧取豪夺的历史。所有这些行径的直接目的，就是要在我们这些州里建立专制的暴政统治。为了证明这一点，特将事实陈诸于世界公正人士之前：

　　他拒绝批准那些对公共福利最有益、最必要的法律。

　　他禁止他的总督们批准那些紧急的、极其重要的法律，除非那些法律在经他同意之前暂停施行；而暂停施行期间，他又对那些法律完全置之不理。他拒绝批准其它有关人民向广大地区迁居的法律，除非那些人民愿意放弃其在立法机关中的代表权；这种代表权对人民来说具有无可估量的意义，只有对暴君来说才是可伯的。他把各州立法团体召集到特别的、极不方便的、远离政府档案库的地方去开会，其唯一的目的就是使他们疲于奔命，不得不顺从他的旨意。

　　他屡次解散各州的议会，因为这些议会曾坚定不移地反抗他对人民权利的侵犯。

　　他在解散各州议会之后，又长时期地不让人民另选新议会；不可抹煞的立法权力又归一般民众行使；而其时各州仍然处于内乱外患的危险之中。

　　他竭力抑制各州的人口增长；为此目的，他为《外国人归化法》设置障碍，拒绝批准其它鼓励外国人移居各州的法律，并提高了重新分配土地的条件。

　　他拒绝批准确立司法权力的法律，从而阻碍司法行政管理工作。

　　他使法官的任职年限、薪金数额及支付办法完全由他个人意志来决定。

　　他滥设新职，派遣大批官吏来钳制我们的人民，耗尽我们人民的财力。

　　他不经我们立法机关的同意，在和平时期就把常备军驻扎在我们各州。

　　他力图使军队独立于政权，并凌驾于政权之上。

　　他与某些人相互勾结，要我们屈服于一种与我们的体制格格不入、没有为我们法律所承认的管辖权之下；并且批准那些炮制的假冒法案。在我们这里驻扎大量的武装部队。用欺骗性审讯来包庇那些杀害我们各州居民的人，使他们得以逍遥法外。切断我们与世界各地的贸易。未经我们的同意即向我们强行征税。在许多案件中剥夺我们的陪审权力。以莫须有的罪名押送我们去海外受审。在邻近的地区废除保障自由的英国法律体制，建立专制政府，并扩大其疆界，企图使它迅即成为一个样板和一件顺手的工具，以便进而把同样的专制统治引向我们这些殖民地。取消我们的宪章，废除我们那些最宝贵的法令，并且从根本上改变我们的政府形式。关闭我们自己的立法机关，有权就一切事宜为我们制定法律。

　　他宣布我们已不受其保护，并对我们开战。这样，表明了他已放弃在这里的政权。

　　他在我们的海域大肆掠夺，骚扰我们的沿海地区，焚毁我们的城镇，并残害我们人民的生命。

　　他此刻正在调运大量的外籍雇佣军，意在制造死亡、毁灭和专制暴虐。他已经造成即使在人类历史上最野蛮的时代都罕见的残暴和背信弃义的气氛。他完全不配做一个文明国家的元首。

　　他强迫在公海上被俘的我们的同胞武装起来反对自己的国家，充当残杀自己亲人和朋友的刽子手，或者死于自己亲人朋友之手。

　　他在我们之间煽动内乱，并竭力挑动我们的边疆居民、那些残酷无情的未开化的印第安人；而印第安人的著名的作战原则是不分男女老幼、不论何种情况，一概格杀勿论。

　　在这些高压政策的每一个阶段，我们都曾以最谦卑的言词请求予以纠正；而每次的吁请所得到的答复都只是屡遭损害。一个君主，当他的每个行为都已打上暴君的烙印时，是不配做自由人民的统治者。

　　我们并没有置我们的英国弟兄于不顾。我们时常提醒他们，他们的立法机构企图把不合理的管辖权横加到我们头上；我们曾提醒他们注意，我们移殖来此和在这里定居的情况。我们曾经向他们天生的正义感和侠义精神呼吁，恳请他们念及同种同宗的情谊，抵制那些掠夺行为以免影响我们之间的联系和友谊。但是，他们对这种正义的、血肉之亲的呼吁置若罔闻。因此，我们不得不宣布与他们脱离，并且以对待世界上其他民族一样的态度对待他们：和我们作战，就是敌人；和我们和好，就是朋友。

　　因此，我们，集合在大会中的美利坚合众国的代表们，以这些殖民地的善良人民的名义，并经他们授权，向全世界最祟高的正义人士呼吁，说明我们的严正意向，同时庄严宣布：这些联合一致的殖民地从此成为、而且按其权利必须成为自由独立的国家；它们已经解除一切效忠于英王室的义务，从此完全断绝、并必须断绝与大不列颠王国之间的一切政治联系。作为自由独立的国家；它们享有全权去宣战、缔和、同盟、通商或采取其它一切独立国家有权采取的行动。为了拥护此项宣言，我们怀着神明保佑的坚定信心，以我们的生命、我们的财产和我们神圣的荣誉，互相宣誓。
